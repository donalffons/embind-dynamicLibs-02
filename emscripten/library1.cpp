// BELOW IS THE ORIGINAL COMMENT FROM THE OPENCASCADE PROJECT, WHICH MIGHT
// HELP TO EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE ORIGINAL FUNCTION. THIS IS JUST A DUMMY
// TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM.
// See here for the original source code:
//   https://git.dev.opencascade.org/gitweb/?p=occt.git;a=blob;f=src/Standard/Standard.cxx;h=78b25e1cb771e8916585cfed94288123a5314753;hb=HEAD#l227

//=======================================================================
// function: GetMMgr
//
// This static function has a purpose to wrap static holder for memory 
// manager instance. 
//
// Wrapping holder inside a function is needed to ensure that it will
// be initialized not later than the first call to memory manager (that
// would be impossible to guarantee if holder was static variable on 
// global or file scope, because memory manager may be called from 
// constructors of other static objects).
//
// Note that at the same time we could not guarantee that the holder 
// object is destroyed after last call to memory manager, since that 
// last call may be from static Handle() object which has been initialized
// dynamically during program execution rather than in its constructor.
//
// Therefore holder currently does not call destructor of the memory manager 
// but only its method Purge() with Standard_True.
//
// To free the memory completely, we probably could use compiler-specific 
// pragmas (such as '#pragma fini' on SUN Solaris and '#pragma init_seg' on 
// WNT MSVC++) to put destructing function in code segment that is called
// after destructors of other (even static) objects. However, this is not 
// done by the moment since it is compiler-dependent and there is no guarantee 
// thatsome other object calling memory manager is not placed also in that segment...
//
// Note that C runtime function atexit() could not help in this problem 
// since its behaviour is the same as for destructors of static objects 
// (see ISO 14882:1998 "Programming languages -- C++" 3.6.3)
//
// The correct approach to deal with the problem would be to have memory manager 
// to properly control its memory allocation and caching free blocks so 
// as to release all memory as soon as it is returned to it, and probably
// even delete itself if all memory it manages has been released and 
// last call to method Purge() was with True.
//
// Note that one possible method to control memory allocations could
// be counting calls to Allocate() and Free()...
